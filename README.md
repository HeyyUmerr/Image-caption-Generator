Creating an image caption generator from scratch is a complex task that typically involves using deep learning techniques, including Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for image feature extraction and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) for caption generation. Below is a simplified example using Python and the Keras library. For a production-ready system, you would typically use more extensive datasets and more complex models.
Please note that running this code requires having the Keras library installed, as well as access to image data and caption data. A pre-trained image feature extraction model like VGG16 or ResNet50 is also necessary.
To implement a complete image caption generator, you would need to:

Preprocess your image and caption data.
Train the image feature extraction model on a large dataset.
Train the caption generation model using paired image-caption data.
Fine-tune the models as needed.
Implement the caption generation process for new images.
Please note that this code is a starting point, and you'll need to adapt it to your specific dataset and requirements.
