# Image-caption-Generator
To implement a complete image caption generator, you would need to:  Preprocess your image and caption data. Train the image feature extraction model on a large dataset. Train the caption generation model using paired image-caption data. Fine-tune the models as needed. Implement the caption generation process for new images.
